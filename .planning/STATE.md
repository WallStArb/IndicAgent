# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Every intelligence output flows through one canonical typed bus that both internal and external consumers can trust.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Typed Event Schema

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Typed Event Schema)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (PHASE COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-02-23 — Plan 01-03 complete: deleted intelligence_processor_service.py, 0 stale refs, Phase 1 done

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (3/15 plans complete, excluding Phase 0)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3 (this milestone)
- Average duration: ~23min
- Total execution time: ~63min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-typed-event-schema | 3 | ~63min | ~21min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~35min), 01-02 (~25min), 01-03 (~3min)
- Trend: On track

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions from design session (2026-02-22):

- Service consolidation: market_analysis_service.py is the sole canonical I3-I6 pipeline; intelligence_processor_service.py deprecated
- Schema: IntelligenceEvent with tiered JSONB (i1/i3/i4/i5/smc/i6), versioned, platform dimension from day 1
- Feature store: intelligence_features hypertable, NO retention policy (keep for seasonal ML), 7-day compression
- Feature Writer: standalone async service consuming feature_writer:persist consumer group
- Auth: single Depends(verify_auth) handling JWT + API keys
- External access: Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS to Vercel frontend

Recent decisions from execution (2026-02-23):

- 01-01: IntelligenceEvent published as single "event" JSON field in Redis stream; extra="forbid" on I3-I6 sub-models
- 01-01: I1Indicators uses extra="allow" (23 plugins, ~50+ dynamic fields); all others strict
- 01-02: _parse_intelligence_event() module-level pattern: pure function, returns None on failure (ack-and-skip)
- 01-02: features dict preserves legacy MARKET_CONTEXT_KEYS names for signal_ledger JSONB stability
- 01-02: smc_trend_direction (schema rename) mapped to SmartMoneyData.trend_direction in dashboard
- 01-02: ai_narrative_service confirmed non-consumer (reads signals: stream only)
- 01-03: Historical plan docs annotated with deprecation banners (not inline edits) to preserve historical accuracy
- 01-03: Stale worktrees out of scope — stale refs in .worktrees/ are on separate branches, not main

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- IBKR TWS must be running on Windows LAN (10.0.0.33) for Phase 3 backfill to run Stage 1 fetch
- Phase 3 backfill duration unknown — 365 days of 1m data across multiple contracts may take significant time; plan accordingly
- Auth (Phase 6) depends only on Phase 4 (API exists), not Phase 5 (ML) — phases can run in parallel if needed

## Session Continuity
