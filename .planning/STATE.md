# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** Every intelligence output flows through one canonical typed bus that both consumers can trust.
**Current focus:** Milestone complete

## Evidence Gates

| Gate | Condition | Blocks |
|------|-----------|--------|
| GUARD gate | Post-Instructor parse failure rate > 1% | Phase 099 executes only if condition true |
| FIT-06 gate | Cross-agent composite score stddev >= 0.2 | Phases 102 and 103 |
| Zep compute gate | Recall p95 latency <= 50ms; RAM footprint documented | Phase 097 enablement |
| DSPy data gate | >= 500 labeled rows per agent in llm_calls | Phase 098 first run |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v2.8 ordering: infrastructure debt first (106-107), then AI platform stack in dependency order (094 → 095 → 096 → 097/098 parallel → 099 conditional), then evolvable agents (101 → 102 → 103).
- Phase 099 is conditional — skip if Instructor brings parse failures below 1%.
- Phases 102-103 are gated on FIT-06 discriminative power; if all agents score within 0.1 of each other, genetic work does not begin.
- All new AI agent behavior runs shadow_only=True; no auto-promotion; operator must confirm fitness gate.
- No new Kafka topics without named producer-consumer pair; no new systemd daemons without justification.
- [Phase 095]: response_format forwarded via conditional dict insert; semantic cache skipped for structured calls; LLMProviderChain in TYPE_CHECKING only.
- [Phase 123]: SIGNAL_SCHEMA_VERSION bumped to v3 to mark ECL field addition in signal payloads
- [Phase 123]: _nullable_float() pattern: None=cold-start, 0.0=genuine neutral — never or 0.0 fallback (ML training integrity)
- [Phase 123]: _PHASE_119_PLUGINS frozenset dissolved: boundary concept no longer needed once all plugins emit ECL annotations
- [Phase 123]: Phase 128 DB persistence deferred: signal_writer reads ECL fields end-to-end but LedgerEntry not extended until 3-table migration
- [Phase 136]: ctf_score=NULL is table-wide in intelligence_features: replay script never wrote Phase-130 CTF dedicated columns; deferred to future fix
- [Phase 136]: Migration 130 Statement 3 UPDATE 0 rows: W2b exclusion at write time already eliminated all ctf_score keys from cross_timeframe_context; cleanup is durable

### Blockers / Concerns

- Phase 099 (Guardrails): do not implement unless post-094 parse failure rate > 1%

## Session Continuity

### Last session (2026-06-20) — analog-engine doc cleanup; Phase 133 ready to execute

Prerequisites complete: 131 ✓ 132 ✓ 134 ✓ 136 ✓. Corpus: 737 signal_events (21/35 plugins).

Key schema facts: `stopped_at_entry` is an `outcome` enum value, not `exit_reason` (B8 fix in Plan 133-02, Gate 6 SQL updated). `trade_frames.signal_ts` already exists — migration 154 adds it only to `trade_executions`. Migration 154 is the hypertable migration (149 was taken by Phase 134).

**Next:** `/gsd-execute-phase 133`

## Current Position

Phase: 133 (clean-corpus-rebuild) — READY TO EXECUTE (plans updated 2026-06-20 for Phase 134 schema changes)
Phase: 135 (controlled-vocabulary-system) — on roadmap, not yet planned
Phase: 136 — COMPLETE (2026-06-19)
Status: Corpus rebuild is the critical path to ML training
