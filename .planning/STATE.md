# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** Every intelligence output flows through one canonical typed bus that both consumers can trust.
**Current focus:** Phase 121 — lifecycle replay & validation

## Evidence Gates

| Gate | Condition | Blocks |
|------|-----------|--------|
| GUARD gate | Post-Instructor parse failure rate > 1% | Phase 099 executes only if condition true |
| FIT-06 gate | Cross-agent composite score stddev >= 0.2 | Phases 102 and 103 |
| Zep compute gate | Recall p95 latency <= 50ms; RAM footprint documented | Phase 097 enablement |
| DSPy data gate | >= 500 labeled rows per agent in llm_calls | Phase 098 first run |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v2.8 ordering: infrastructure debt first (106-107), then AI platform stack in dependency order (094 → 095 → 096 → 097/098 parallel → 099 conditional), then evolvable agents (101 → 102 → 103).
- Phase 099 is conditional — skip if Instructor brings parse failures below 1%.
- Phases 102-103 are gated on FIT-06 discriminative power; if all agents score within 0.1 of each other, genetic work does not begin.
- All new AI agent behavior runs shadow_only=True; no auto-promotion; operator must confirm fitness gate.
- No new Kafka topics without named producer-consumer pair; no new systemd daemons without justification.
- [Phase 095]: response_format forwarded via conditional dict insert; semantic cache skipped for structured calls; LLMProviderChain in TYPE_CHECKING only.

### Blockers / Concerns

- Phase 099 (Guardrails): do not implement unless post-094 parse failure rate > 1%

## Session Continuity

### Last session (2026-06-10) — v2.9 Phases 117-120 complete

All four signal quality refactoring phases executed and verified:

- Phase 117: PatternCompletion write-path bug fixed; FeatureParityAuditor + ConfidenceCalibrationMonitor deployed
- Phase 118: Extrinsic confidence modifiers stripped across 12 I7 plugins; top 5 NEEDS_REFACTOR setups refactored to intrinsic-only confidence
- Phase 119: All 16 remaining NEEDS_REFACTOR setups refactored; validate_tier() enforcement + CI gate added
- Phase 120: ShadowModeValidator oneshot deployed (Mon 07:00 UTC); shadow_auditor.py SoC-split to demotion-only; migration 121 (signal_ledger_shadow view) applied; _ONESHOT_UNITS gap fixed in service_auditor.py

Key architectural decision: shadow signal `win_rate` (binomtest vs 50% baseline) replaces `selection_rate` — shadow signals can never have `was_selected=True` since they never enter the active aggregator pool.

**Resume:** `/clear` then `/gsd-discuss-phase 121` or `/gsd-plan-phase 121` in fresh context.
